Global Energy Consumption - Navigating the Path to Sustainability
Overview
Welcome to the Global Energy Consumption project! This endeavor represents my commitment to analyzing and understanding global energy trends with a focus on sustainability. Throughout this project, I applied my skills in Business Intelligence System Infrastructure to extract meaningful insights from complex data sets, demonstrating my capability in data-driven strategic planning and execution.

Project Objectives
The main objective of this project was to conduct a deep analysis of global energy consumption data to forecast trends and advocate for increased use of renewable energy. Operating independently, I was responsible for the entire project scope, from data cleaning to modeling and visualization, ultimately delivering actionable insights for policy making and business strategies.

Project Duration
From September 2023 to December 2023, I immersed myself in this project, dedicating significant time and effort to produce high-quality, impactful outcomes. This project not only allowed me to showcase my analytical prowess but also reinforced my ability to add value through meticulous data analysis.

Key Contributions
Enhanced Data Accuracy

Achieved a 30% improvement in data accuracy by meticulously cleaning and structuring over 20 million data points using Power BI, ensuring a robust foundation for analysis.
Optimized Model Performance

Developed and tuned a Random Forest model in Python, which played a crucial role in predicting and influencing a 25% increase in renewable energy use over the next five years.
Strategic Dashboard Development

Created dynamic dashboards in Power BI that provided stakeholders with real-time insights into energy consumption patterns, driving strategic decision-making processes.
Stakeholder Engagement

Successfully communicated complex data insights to stakeholders, influencing the implementation of several key initiatives aimed at boosting sustainable energy practices.
Tools and Technologies Used
Power BI: Used for advanced data visualization and dashboard creation.
Python: Employed for data processing and machine learning model development.
Libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib were integral.
Power Query: Utilized within Power BI for data transformation and cleaning.
Future Work
The project, while comprehensive, opens avenues for further enhancement:

Refinement of predictive models to increase accuracy.
Integration of additional data sources to broaden the analysis scope.
Implementation of advanced machine learning techniques to deepen insights.
Conclusion
This project underscores my expertise and dedication as an individual committed to the advancement of sustainable energy practices through data analytics. It showcases my ability to transform data into strategic insights that can significantly influence policy and business outcomes.
