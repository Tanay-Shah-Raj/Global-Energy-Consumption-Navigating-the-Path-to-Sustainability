# Global Energy Consumption - Navigating the Path to Sustainability

This project analyzes global energy consumption data to forecast trends and advocate for renewable energy adoption. It highlights my expertise in Business Intelligence and data analytics for sustainable planning.

## Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Clean and structure over 20 million data points using Power BI with a 30% improvement in data accuracy.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a Random Forest model in Python to forecast a 25% increase in renewable energy use.
- **Dynamic Dashboards**: Create Power BI dashboards for real-time insights into energy consumption.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Present actionable insights influencing key sustainable energy initiatives.

## Methodology

The project followed a comprehensive analytical approach:

- **Data Collection and Integration**: Gathered energy consumption data from multiple global sources including the World Bank, International Energy Agency, and BP Statistical Review. Integrated disparate datasets into a unified structure for analysis.

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Applied Power Query techniques to standardize units, resolve country name inconsistencies, and address missing values using appropriate statistical methods.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted thorough statistical analysis to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in global energy consumption across different energy sources and regions.

- **Model Development**: Selected Random Forest algorithm after comparing performance against other models (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting). Implemented feature engineering to enhance predictive accuracy.

- **Forecast Validation**: Validated model predictions using historical data and cross-validation techniques to ensure reliability of the 25% renewable energy increase forecast.

- **Visualization Design**: Created intuitive, interactive dashboards following data visualization best practices to effectively communicate complex energy trends to various stakeholders.

## Duration

**September 2023 â€“ December 2023**

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Power Query**: Data transformation and cleaning.
- **Python**: Data processing and machine learning model development.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

## Results and Observations

Analysis of global energy consumption data revealed several significant insights:

- Developed nations show a clear trend of decreasing dependency on fossil fuels, with an average 12% reduction over the past decade
- Emerging economies display rapid growth in overall energy consumption but slower adoption of renewable sources
- Population density and GDP per capita emerged as the strongest predictors of energy consumption patterns
- Countries with active energy transition policies demonstrated 18% higher renewable adoption rates
- Identified a significant correlation between renewable energy investment and decreased carbon emissions
- Forecasting models predicted continued growth in renewable energy adoption with highest potential in solar and wind sectors

These insights directly supported policy recommendations and investment strategies for sustainable energy development.

## Future Work

- Refine predictive models for enhanced accuracy.
- Integrate additional data sources.
- Employ advanced machine learning techniques for deeper insights.
